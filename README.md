# Rocket_Elevators_Controllers
Contains the algorithm files for the elevator controllers for the New Rocket Elevator Solutions for both Residential and Commercial Offers

<h2>Residential Alogrithm</h2>
The algorithm for the residential services provided by Rocket Elevators is found in the <i>Residential_Controller.algo</i> file. I also built it on <storng>Javascript and <strong>Python </strong>
applying it to a residential building with 10 stories and 2 elevators.
<br/>
Please notice that several test scenarios are provided in each file, so you can see the algorithm in action. In order to run these tests, just uncomment the functions <strong>scenario1()</strong>, 
<strong>scenario2()</strong> and <strong>scenario3()</strong> in the "test section" (line 281 to 283 in the JavaScript file and 221 to 214 in the Python one)
<br/>
To see the results of the JS test, you'll need to:
<ol>
<li>Open the <a href src="Resi-JS-Test.html">Resi-JS-Test.html<a> file in your browser</li>

</ol>
